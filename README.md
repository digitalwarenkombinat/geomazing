# Cooperation with Geomazing

> A scavenger hunt progressive web application created with Twine and Mapbox GL JS.

Together with [Gregor Asfalg (Geomazing)](https://geomazing.com/), we have developed the web app 'Flamingo Flucht'. With the help of this digital scavenger hunt through Aschersleben, the players try to find escaped zoo animals and discover exciting places and city stories along the way.
